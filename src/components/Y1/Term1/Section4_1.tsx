                                In their inaugural term at High Gate
                                International Academy, primary section students
                                embarked on an innovative integrated learning
                                program, harmonizing the renowned Cambridge
                                international Curriculum with a novel French
                                curriculum from France Education International.
                                This pioneering approach seeks to establish a
                                solid foundation for the Canadian education
                                system, particularly in the preschool phase
                                conducted entirely in French.

                                The school has strategically appointed
                                specialist teachers, Mr. Christian and Mr.
                                Emmanuel Magerha, who have successfully
                                completed their initial Masters courses at
                                Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, a prestigious
                                institution consistently ranking among the top
                                100-250 universities globally. Their dedication
                                to ongoing education is exemplified by their
                                pursuit of a second Masters, reflecting the
                                commitment of High Gate International Academy to
                                providing students with an unparalleled
                                bilingual French-speaking environment.
